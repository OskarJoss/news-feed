# Code review

* Good consistent syntax
* functions.php - Forgot to declare strict in functions.php
* Readme.md - missing information(Good if you try to update it as you go)
* index.php - Maybe try breaking the head out into its own file for when you want to add more pages
* Don’t forget to optimise your images
